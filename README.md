# QLogger

A simple logging client.

## TODO

### before release
- make sure api calls are solid, prob with thunderbird or smth
- db calls
- functional auth, maybe a sign in

### after
- move database into internal?
- maybe use something other than json for speed?
- better auth handling
- better error handling
