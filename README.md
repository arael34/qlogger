# QLogger

A simple logging client.

## To set up locally

Install go and git, then install deps with ```go get```

Create .env file according to the example

Run ```go run cmd/main.go```

!! Important! make sure you're running from the root of the project, not the cmd folder.

## TODO

- filter feature
- context.TODO()
- refresh button, websocket for realtime
- maybe use something other than json for speed?
- better auth handling
- better error handling
